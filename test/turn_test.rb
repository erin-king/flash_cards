# correct? - This method returns a boolean indicating if the guess matched the answer on the Card.
# feedback - This method either returns "Correct!" or "Incorrect." based on whether the guess was correct or not.
# The Turn class should respond to the following interaction pattern:

# pry(main)> card = Card.new("What is the capital of Alaska?", "Juneau", :Geography)
# #=> #<Card:0x00007f800e29f0c8 @question=""What is the capital of Alaska?", @answer="Juneau", @category=:Geography>
#
# pry(main)> turn = Turn.new("Juneau", card)
# #=> #<Turn:0x00007f99842f0998 @card=#<Card:0x00007f800e29f0c9 @question=""What is the capital of Alaska?", @answer="Juneau", @guess="Juneau">
